#  Neural Network-NN

###  This Code Is About Hebbian Learning Rule In Neural Network(NN).

###  This is one layer model of neural network.

###  Hebb's law is one of the earliest and simplest learning rules in neural networks.

###  This rule is suitable for neural networks with one layer.

###  It is used to train neural networks.

###  when a neuron repeatedly and simultaneously fires with another neuron,the weight between these two neurons is strengthened.

###  This law is used to learn patterns in neural networks.
